# Assignment

For this assignment, create a folder and name it ‘js-basics’. Put the answers to Questions 1 - 7 in a file named ‘readme.md’.

• What runs JavaScript outside the browser ?

Ans: You can run JavaScript console in terminal or any command-line interface using Node. js, an open-source, platform-agnostic runtime that executes JavaScript outside a web browser.

• Name 5 things Javascript can do.
Ans:

1. Creating Web and mobile apps
2. Building web servers and developing server applications
3. Game development
4. Adding interactive behavior to web pages
5. Embedded Device Development and IoT
6. Data Visualization
7. write plugins for popular applications
8. Artificial Intelligence
9. Desktop Applications
10. JavaScript as a Serverless Computing Programming Langauge.

• When was ECMAScript first released ? \
Ans: JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995.

• How do you log to the console? \
Ans: The console.log() is a function in JavaScript that is used to print any kind of variables defined before in it or to just print any message to the console.

• List the tech fields that use JavaScript. \
Ans:

1. Front End Web Developer
2. Web Application Developer
3. JavaScript Developer
4. Web Designer
5. Full Stack Developer

6. • Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category \
   Ans:

   - Statically-Typed Languages
     We call a language “statically-typed” if it follows type checking during compilation. So, every detail about the variables and all the data types must be known before we do the compiling process.

   - In this type of language, once a variable is assigned a type, it can’t be assigned to some other variable of a different type. If we try to do so, the compiler will raise some errors, and we need to fix them. Hence, for a declared variable, the data type is fixed.Some examples of statically-typed languages are Java, C, C++, C#, Swift, Scala, Kotlin, Fortran, Pascal, Rust, Go, COBOL, etc.

   - Dynamically-typed Languages
     We call a language “dynamically typed” if type checking takes place while the program runs (run-time). In this type of language, there is no need to specify the data type of each variable while writing code.

   - It means that you can write pretty quickly since you do not have to specify types every time. Some languages do allow you to provide type information but do not require it. Most modern programming languages are dynamically typed. Some examples of dynamically-typed languages are Python, Javascript, Ruby, Perl, PHP, R, Dart, Lua, Objective-C, etc.

• Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined’. \
Ans: - The JavaScript null — also known as nill — is a keyword that normally represents the absence of value.

    - undefined is a global property that represents the primitive data value undefined. There are 3 ways that indicates when a system returns undefined.
    - Firstly, when a variable has not been assigned a value yet.
    - Secondly, when the variable that is being evaluated in a method or statement does not have an assigned value.
    - Thirdly, when a function returns no value.

#

• In the ‘js-basics’ folder you created above, create a file and name it ‘index.js’. Inside the file, Write a function that multiples two numbers. Call that function to multiply any two numbers of your choice and log the answer in your console
• In the same index.js file, create variables for your first name, last name, Stutern track, skills, favourite color, year of your country’s independence. Use these variables to form a sentence and log the sentence in the console.
• Push your work into a Github repository and submit the Github repository link in Citrone.
